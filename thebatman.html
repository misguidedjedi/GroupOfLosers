<p>For some reason, I was not prepared for the lack of backstory. The movie tries to stand on its own but also assumes that you’re already familiar with most of the characters, which I guess was a logical approach for them to take but it made the movie feel kind of off and more like a sequel which leaves you filling in the gaps and for me, made it difficult to care about this version of some of the characters.

With that out of the way, It’s a great movie! The take on batman/bruce was definitely unique and different than any other live action batman so far and that's something considering how many there have been. As indicated by the advertisements, it’s more of a detective story which is fun and reminded me of the 1966 Batman in some ways except that this Batman is smart and can solve things without robin.

The soundtrack was amazing and there was a couple of really good action scenes that I thoroughly enjoyed but also theres things that could've made the movie better if they were altered or cut. All things considered, It's worthwhile and an intresting film but falls short, especially When compared to the likes of Batman Begins and the Dark Knight.

    I give this movie a 7.5/10</p>
