<p>I started watching this show about 5 months ago and just finished watching a week ago. While I couldn’t be more excited for this to be the first thing I review here, the show isn’t entirely without flaws. Let me start by saying that I found the show highly enjoyable, especially watching it from start to finish because on top of the subtle but very good character development they were always talking about geek stuff and you get to relive a lot of major releases during it’s 12 season run from 2007-2019. The show does a good job at being geeky but I don’t think to an extreme. Unfortunately the show does slightly does change its formula here and there I think it was season 3 I didn’t care for as much but it gets better from again there and the occasional formula change is probably what kept the show feeling fresh for 12 years. After all, change is a part of life. <br><br>



The show focuses on a group of friends (mostly scientists) and with the show being named after a scientific theory, obviously, one of the shows main themes is science. Unless you’re literally a scientist, you’re not gonna completely understand 100% of everything that’s said but that’s usually the point and the only time the science really goes in-depth is for comedic purposes. Speaking of comedic purposes, I don’t usually laugh out loud at most comedies (especially when watching by myself) However, this one got me a handful of times throughout.<br><br>



You might be interested to know that despite the show being named the Big Bang theory, it doesn’t go out of it’s way to disprove the existence of God. In fact one of the main characters is Jewish and a recurring guest character is Christian. Religion is far from the shows focus point and when it Is brought up, it doesn’t go overboard one way or another. <br><br>



I do want to note that there are a lot of mild sexual themes especially in the earlier seasons but nothing too serious. <br><br>



Conclusion: Overall It’s a great series! for the first time since watching suits back in 2020, I was able to get invested in a show with over 2 seasons which feels nice. If you've never watched this show and have been debating it, I definitely recommend! Be sure to come back and <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/sc0xuAPfMBuNSHpVg8NGUlgp58CAuS4wQyPkI8DHdMoiDPs2LJrLl6htdhNSU_hjiGoP_O2poxMRQwFcrsa0pZz5mhrr9ZDe-m5xxYVYiUBpPEqqoM7qjg9MeXoc6drcogVkNBPKqw=w2400">click here</a> after watching all the episodes.</p>
