<p>I started watching this show about 5 months ago and just finished a week ago. Let me start by saying that I found the show highly enjoyable, especially watching it from start to finish because of the very subtle but good character development along the way and also because of how they were always talking about geek stuff and you get to relive a lot of major releases during it’s 12 season run from 2007-2019. Unfortunately, the show does slightly change its format a couple of times which I suppose is kind of to be expected and probably part of what kept it going strong for 12 years. overall the plot and synopsis remain the same and the cast and writers were incredible.  <br><br>

The show focuses on a group of friends (mostly scientists) and with the show being named after a scientific theory, obviously one of it's main themes is science. Unless you’re literally a scientist, you’re not gonna completely understand 100% of everything that’s said but that’s usually the point and the only time the science really goes in-depth is for comedic purposes. Speaking of, I don’t usually laugh out loud at most TV shows (especially when watching by myslef) but this one had me a number of times throughout.<br><br>

You might be interested to know if you don't already that despite the shows title, one of the main characters is Jewish and a recurring guest character is Christian. Religion is far from the shows focus point and when brought up, it doesn’t go overboard one way or another. Somewhat on topic, This feels like a good time to mention that there are a lot of mild sexual themes especially in the earlier seasons. <br><br>


Conclusion: It’s a great series! For the first time since watching <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=suits&rlz=1C1VDKB_enUS942US942&oq=suits&aqs=chrome..69i57j46i433i512j46i67i199i291i433j0i67i433l3j0i512j0i433i512j0i67i433j0i271.2135j1j4&sourceid=chrome&ie=UTF-8">Suits</a> back in 2020, I was able to get invested in a show with over 2 seasons which feels good. I'm afraid my review here didn't make the show seem all that intresting as I was trying to be objective but If you've never watched The Big Bang Theory and have been debating it, I definitely recommend! <br><br>  Be sure to come back and <a href="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/fQGYBWYe5nw_cKS61Z51oToldYA5_0j5uhBLw11LuxvzFjK1Bh7BC9Cl9uEX9fkclbOAtib2UdWH7HtIm4PV_YDTGZsFV1-x7AwuLYaOiHg46hfQ_0z5pBlQhwhdlz4SzuF-rHEprQ=w2400">click here</a> after watching all the episodes.</p>
